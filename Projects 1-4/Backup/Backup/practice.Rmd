## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 41)

nurses <- tuesdata$nurses

nursesSub <- nurses %>% select(c(2, 3, 5, 7)) %>% filter_at(vars(Year,`Total Employed RN`, `Hourly Wage Avg`, `Annual Salary Avg`), all_vars(!is.na(.)))

glimpse(nursesSub)
```
```{r}
 nursesSub %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Total Employed RN`)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
    xlab("class") +
    theme(legend.position="none") +
    xlab("")
```
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 41)

nurses <- tuesdata$nurses[!is.na(tuesdata$nurses)]


glimpse(nurses)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
